Roll the ball and collect all the coins in this Unity game!

**For copyright reasons, the Assets/Models folder had been removed from the repo's history, and then re-imported with the ["Update assets folder architecture" commit](https://github.com/TheLycorisRadiata/game_unity_themrollybois/tree/fbf0695999570573031a05f3985362e2efab5750) containing only the authorized assets. Either way, without all the meshes and textures the project clone will be broken.**

## RANDOM NOTES

- Implement a button, anything, to be able to switch the bumper/jumper's activation.
- I want the twin feature: when stepping into some zone, the player duplicates, you now control two balls at once. And when you step into another zone, you go back to being singular. Oh, ok, you know what? Whenever a ball steps into the thingy, it duplicates, so you can find yourself with lots of balls. Of course, you can also merge until you find yourself singular again.
- Any ball can be destroyed, and I want a small explosion (Synty Prototype Pack).
- When a ball is destroyed, the coins it gathered are lost as well.

- The game is one procgen level.
- The goal is to earn as many points as possible, such as with Snake, the Dino game, the Upward-Jumping game...
- Maybe I could take inspiration from the blind game with the sound-sensitive monsters.

- There is no pause and there is also no way to defeat enemies directly, you use your surroundings to block them or simply to escape.
- There is a menu, however, which gets rid of your current game (but we save your score in case it was a record). The menu is used for sound settings etc, as well as loading a map, because yes you can save maps that have been generated for you. You could also create a map yourself and load it. It's a simple way to mod a game. There is no way however to decide on the game difficulty, it becomes increasingly difficult, unless you load a specific map, in which case the game simply refers to the map and doesn't use procgen to create the level.

- It's a solo game.
- I'd love to have it on mobile.
